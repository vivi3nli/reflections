When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    I would like to use a remote repository when I'm collaborating with someone else or I'm using another computer rather than mine yet I want to keep working on the same code.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    
    I cannot rally think of why now, it might because when several people are working on the same projects and everyone is not finished yet, if Git automatically sync the files may cause conflects or loss.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
   
   forks:a clone of other's github repository on my github server
   clones: a copy of a certain repository
   branches: different version of the same repository deriving from a certain point

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 
   In this way I can keep track of every commit that have been pushed to remote, so that I'm working on the latest version of the repository on remote.
